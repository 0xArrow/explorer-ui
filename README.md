# Alethio Explorer UI

Library of UI components usable inside Alethio Explorer plugins

*NOTICE*: The master branch hosts the latest development version (v2.x). For the legacy 1.x version, please see the v1 branch.

## Requirements

- The components will only work inside an Alethio Explorer plugin. They depend on its plugin API which is dynamically created at runtime.

- A bundler is required as the library exports individual files in ES module format.
